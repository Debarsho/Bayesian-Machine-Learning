# Machine-Learning ( Bayesian )
Summer Project 2019 under Programming Club - IIT Kanpur

This is a implementation of Bayesian Linear Regression.
In the Bayesian viewpoint, we formulate linear regression using probability distributions rather than point estimates. 
The response, y, is not estimated as a single value, but is assumed to be drawn from a probability distribution.
